## üìå About 

This page is an implementation of the FAQ Accordion Card challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of the challenge is to create an accordion-style card that displays frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers when clicked. Here are some of the **key features of the page:**

- The page uses **HTML**, **CSS**, **SCSS** and **BEM (Block Element Modifier) Methodology** to create the accordion card layout and styling;
- The page utilizes JavaScript to implement the accordion functionality, allowing users to click on a question to reveal its answer;
- The design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and device types;
- The page includes an image of a computer screen displaying the FAQ card to showcase the final result of the challenge;
